# PyDynamics
A physics engine written in python for rigid body simulations with contacts.

# Note:
Please note that the check_collision() method in the PhysicsEngine class is not implemented and should be replaced with a proper collision detection algorithm, such as bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), spatial partitioning (e.g., octree or grid), or other collision detection techniques depending on the specific requirements of the physics engine.
